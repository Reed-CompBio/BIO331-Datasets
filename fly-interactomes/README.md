# _Drosophila_ Interactomes

The _Drosophila_ interactome here is modified from the fly interactome put together by Anna and Derek as part of their NSF Grant.  It combines multiple resources of fly protein-protein interaction data.  Refer to the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/annaritz/fly-interactome) for more information.

The `Fly.txt` undirected, unweighted network is parsed from `interactome/interactome-uniprot-collapsed-evidence.txt`, which collapses UniProt identifiers into common gene names.
